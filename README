This is a collection of useful scripts I use in day-to-day work:

conky_weather.pl
  Pulls weather information from wunderground.com and displays it in a format
  that can be used in conky

delicious_to_base_format.pl
  This script converts an exported Delicious Bookmarks file into a markup used
  at http://st.mahesha.com/bs/. This markup is very similar to the Bookmarks
  file used in browsers.

google_bookmarks_to_base_format.pl
  This script converts an exported Google Bookmarks file into a markup used at
  http://st.mahesha.com/bs/. This markup is very similar to the Bookmarks file
  used in browsers.
